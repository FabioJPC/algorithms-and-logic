# Algorithms and Logic

This repository contains small algorithmic challenges solved with a focus on **clarity**, **correctness**, and **time/space complexity**.

The main goal is to practice problem‑solving and demonstrate **how I reason about algorithms**, not just to produce working code.

Most solutions aim for **O(n)** or **O(n log n)** time complexity and **linear space** when possible.

Each file is **self‑contained** and includes:

* the problem statement
* the solution
* simple test cases

---

## Approach & Principles

* Prefer **clear and readable solutions** over clever but obscure ones
* Explicitly analyze **time and space complexity**
* Use Python built‑in data structures consciously (`dict`, `set`, `list`)
* Avoid unnecessary work and premature optimization
* Always preserve **correctness** and handle **edge cases**

---

## Structure

Each algorithm is implemented in its own file. Example:

* `stable_score_ranking.py`
* `sliding_window_max_sum.py`
* `two_pointers_pair_sum.py`

You can open any file independently to understand the problem and the solution without external dependencies.

## Notes

This repository is intentionally kept simple. The focus is on **reasoning, trade‑offs, and clean implementation**, rather than framework usage or large‑scale architecture.
